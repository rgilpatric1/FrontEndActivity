    <h2>Mission:</h2>
    <p>
        Code the Way partners with high schools, technology companies, and local nonprofit companies
        to offer students advanced computer science training and real-world experiences. The student’s
        software development projects benefit local nonprofit companies, that otherwise could not afford
        these technology solutions, resulting in improved efficiencies and the ability to help more people
        in the community.
    </p>

    <p>
        <br />
        Code the way model includes:
        <br />
        Student access to real-world work experience
        – Students simulate current industry processes and practices working on projects that impact the local community culminating with a presentation of their accomplishments to community business leaders.
        Helping the local community
        <br />
        – Students create custom software solutions to aid local nonprofit companies in meeting
        their mission and vision, ultimately helping those in the local community.
        Companies are part of the solution
        <br />
        – Companies invest in education, make technology more accessible to nonprofits, offer their
        employees a meaningful volunteer experience, and contribute to the talent pipeline.
        <br />
