        <h2>Mission:</h2>
        <p>



            Code the Way partners with high schools, technology companies, and local nonprofit companies
            to offer students advanced computer science training and real-world experiences. The student’s
            software development projects benefit local nonprofit companies, that otherwise could not afford
            these technology solutions, resulting in improved efficiencies and the ability to help more people
            in the community.
        </p>
